## üí° **Example usage**

### Upload an image

```bash
curl -X POST https://img.arroweffect.com/upload   -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"path":"tests/test.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","fileBase64":"<encoded>"}'
```

### Delete an image

curl -X POST https://img.arroweffect.com/delete   -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"path":"tests/test.jpg"}'

```

## üöÄ **Notes**

- Serving image requests (`GET`) does not require auth.
- Uploads are cached for 1 year (`max-age=31536000`).
- Deleted files will 404, but Cloudflare cached copies may still respond `HIT` until cache is purged.
- Consider versioning file paths (e.g. `/v2/cover.jpg`) to avoid cache invalidation headaches.

---

## üìå **Future improvements**

- Add OpenAPI spec
- Support multipart upload for large files
- Add cache tags for more flexible purging
